# landing-page
Odin project to create a landing page

Using this project to build the landing page for my own website.

Put what I've learned so far to use:

	+ Flex-box layout
	+ CSS styling for font styles, colors, and background 
	+ Linking to other pages and external content
	+ Adding images to a web-page
	+ The process of building a complete web-page from scratch. This includes
			- Using git for version control(?)
			- Using best practice methods for writing code
			- Designing a page to my own specific ideas based on the brief given by TOP
