# landing-page
Odin project to create a landing page

Using this project to build the landing page for my own website.

Put what I've learned so far to use:

	+ Flex-box layout
	+ CSS styling for font styles, colors, and background 
	+ Linking to other pages and external content
	+ Adding images to a web-page
	+ The process of building a complete web-page from scratch. This includes
			- Using git for version control(?)
			- Using best practice methods for writing code
			- Designing a page to my own specific ideas based on the brief given by TOP
			

Post-project assessment:

	Have I met the above goals and what have I learned from the process:
	
		+ Used flexbox successfully, I think! 
			- Definitely learned a lot around the importance of nesting divs and targeting
				them and/or their contents correctly 
			- Still a lot to learn but I feel like I have given myself a firm understanding
				of the basics.
		+ Used CSS for styling. Not sure the end reult looks that appealing but that
			wasn't the goal.
		+ Added links to other pages within the site and to external content
			- The other pages are bare-bones but that's not the point at the moment
			- Linked to external content via the logo image which is generated every time
				the site reloads by randomly selecting an image from unsplash.com 
		+ Added images to a webpage
			- Also created my own gifs and added these which was a fun bonus!
		+ Built a web-page, and technically a web-site, from scratch
			- Got a lot of practice using git to save changes, add comments and push the changes.
				This has been very helpful in getting me in the habit of using git
			- Created a branch of the project and worked on that for the "personal" version of
				the site. This was my first time doing it and was extremely useful in getting an 	
				idea of how it works
		+ Not sure if I've been working with 'best practices' but I have tried to keep code 
			neat and organised and NOT use comments for lengthy essays to myself(!) This will be
			an ongoing learning curve
		+ Designed my own version of the site still based somewhat on the brief. This was fun 	
			researching other layouts, designs, etc. to try. I still don't think it would be 
			a design I'd use myself but it's a starting point. Main influence was this site
